# Project context for Claude Code

This repository is a Bitcoin cross-asset regime study. The complete build
specification is in docs/BUILD-SPEC-bitcoin-regime-study.md. Read it fully
at the start of every session before writing any code.

## Non-negotiables
- Never fabricate data, numbers, or citations. If a data source fails, stop and
  report the failure. Do not generate placeholder or synthetic data.
- This project is descriptive, not predictive. No trading signals, no price
  forecasts, no strategy backtests.
- Never shuffle time-series data in cross-validation. Walk-forward only.
- Readability over cleverness. The repo owner is a Python beginner who must be
  able to explain every line in a job interview.
- All tunable parameters live in src/config.py. No magic numbers elsewhere.
- Log every non-obvious decision to docs/decisions-log.md.
- Print row counts before and after every merge.

## Environment
- Windows, PowerShell, Python 3.11+, virtual environment at .venv
- Activate with: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
- Secrets are in .env (FRED_API_KEY). Never read it aloud, never commit it.

## Commands
- Full pipeline: python -m src.run_all (Windows, no `make` installed — see
  docs/decisions-log.md)
- Tests: pytest tests/

## Current phase
Phase 2 — not started. Update this line at the end of every session.
